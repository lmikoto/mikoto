# Extended Sample Character for Don't Starve Together
A character mod template.

The full tutorial can be found on the Klei forums [here](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/46849-tutorial-using-extended-sample-character-template/)

Features:
- Basic coding for a character mod
- All sprites and symbols to build a character
- Extended drawing areas for custom art
- Updated for Don't Starve Together

This requires Don't Starve Mod Tools to autocompile .png files that are modified.
The .scml is built in a way that you can use Spriter (included with Don't Starve Mod Tools) to preview the changes you make. The .scml file is not intended to be changed itself, and changes may not correctly reflect how it appears in-game.
A folder of cleared sprites has been included to easily remove unwanted parts from your character.
